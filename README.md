CoffeePay_Predictor:-
A neural network model to predict coffee payment methods (cash vs card) using transaction data. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, model building, evaluation, and visualization with Python, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.

📂 Project Overview:-
This project uses a coffee sales dataset to:
1.Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features).
2.Build a binary classification neural network to predict payment type.
3.Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4.Visualize training vs validation loss and accuracy curves.

⚙️ Tech Stack:-
1.Python
2.Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
3.Scikit-Learn – Preprocessing & evaluation
4.TensorFlow / Keras – Neural Network modeling
5.Matplotlib – Visualization

🚀 How to Run:-
1.Clone the repo:
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/CoffeePay_Predictor.git
       cd CoffeePay_Predictor
2.Install dependencies:
       pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the script:
       python coffeepay_predictor.py

📊 Results:-
The model outputs:
1.Accuracy
2.Precision
3.Recall
4.F1-score
5.Classification report

It also plots:
1.Training vs Validation Loss
2.Training vs Validation Accuracy

📌 Future Improvements:-
1.Add Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with sales insights.
2.Compare with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
3.Build a web app to predict payment type in real-time.
